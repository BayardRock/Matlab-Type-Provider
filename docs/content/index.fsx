Example
-------

Assume we loaded [Titanic data set](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted) 
into a data frame called `titanic` (the data frame has numerous columns including string 
`Sex` and Boolean `Survived`). Now we can calculate the survival rates for males and females:

*)
#r "MatlabTypeProvider.dll"
open FSMatlab

// put test code here

Samples & documentation

The library comes with comprehensible documentation. The tutorials and articles are 
automatically generated from `*.fsx` files in [the samples folder][samples]. The API
reference is automatically generated from Markdown comments in the library implementation.

 * [Stuff](stuff.html) has more stuff

 * [API Reference](reference/index.html) contains automatically generated documentation for all types, modules
   and functions in the library. This includes additional brief samples on using most of the
   functions.
