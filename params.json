{"name":"F# Matlab Type Provider","tagline":"A (not yet complete) Type Provider for Matlab in the spirit of the R Type Provider","body":"### What to expect\r\n\r\nFor 1.0 I want to have support for most Matlab types and functions.  Currently it just allows you pull in a few types of variables after you connect.  It's highly unstable and under heavy work.  You should probably just wait a week or two for the initial release.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Matlab 2013a (currently uses strjoin quite a bit)\r\n* Visual Studio 2012\r\n\r\n### Current Capabilities\r\n\r\n* Access non-complex Values, Matrices and Vectors in a strongly typed fashion. \r\n\r\n### Known Problems\r\n\r\n* The current communication interface is COM, and I expect this puts a limit on the size of things.  I hope to be moving to the dll interface once I get things going a bit more.  In the long run I'd very much like to be able to support MacOS and Linux.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nAdd the following parameters to your Matlab 2013a shortcut:\r\n\r\n`matlab.exe -automation -desktop`\r\n\r\nThis will allow you to keep a Matlab session open while you connect and disconnect with Visual Studio. Then just access vars like so from inside of Visual Studio: \r\n\r\n`let xFromMatlab = Matlab.COMTypeProvider.Var.X`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
